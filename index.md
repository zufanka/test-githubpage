# Media ownership
Media filter and disseminate information. But who makes the choices of what information to spread? Media ownership plays a very important role in this. However, data on the company structures and shareholders of media companies are in many cases difficult to find or not publicly available at all. We have collected resources and datasets on mostly European media ownership. See the resources per country below.
